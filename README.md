# 🚀 Task 8: K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

Welcome to **Task 8**, where we explore how machines can discover patterns on their own using **K-Means Clustering**.  
No external dataset is needed — everything is generated inside Python!

---

## 🎯 Objective
Use **K-Means** to automatically group similar data points into clusters and understand how unsupervised learning works.

---

## 🧪 What This Project Includes
- 🌱 Synthetic dataset creation  
- 📏 Feature scaling  
- 📉 Elbow Method (to find the best K)  
- 🎯 K-Means clustering  
- ⭐ Silhouette Score evaluation  
- 🎨 PCA-based 2D visualization  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn
